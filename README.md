Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Fourplay, Four in a Row, Four in a Line and
Gravitrips (in Soviet Union) ) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns 
dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, 
occupying the next available space within the column. 

Basically, this program lets 2 players play Connect Four.
